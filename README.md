## Abstract
Greenhouse climate control is becoming increasingly important as climate variability increases, especially in various agro-climatic zones. However, fault tolerance is often a problem, especially in current models that tend to fail because they are sensitive to sensor failure, lack generalization ability, and have extremely high computing requirements. This study proposed a forecasting framework to improve fault tolerance and adaptive learning capabilities by incorporating Climatic Influence Indicators (CII), incorporated with more complex deep learning models, to accurately and rapidly forecast the greenhouse micro-climate. We utilized a multivariate greenhouse dataset, which consisted of temperature, humidity, CO₂ levels, radiation, and water uptake. The CII layer uses embedded temporal importance from input signals in order to improve the reliability of the model in the event of a sensor failure. A review of literature saw research performed on LSTM, GRU models; however, very few papers approached the dual problems of fault tolerance and ease of deployment. Results suggest some mildly successful outcomes, including TCN: 98.89%, PLSTM: 94.86%, XGBoost: 99.59% TFT: 98.16% and CNN + BiLSTM: 99.67%.
